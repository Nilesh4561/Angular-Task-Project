METHOD 1 : WITHOUT NODE MODULE
step - 1:
npm install json-server in workspace folder
like : D:\Machine Test For Angular>npm install json-server
it is as i have used json-server as a database to store all the values

step - 2:
run json-server --watch db.json in workspace folder
if new file is created then remove all the code from the file and add
{
  "task": []
}
like : D:\Machine Test For Angular>json-server --watch db.json
this will create and host a temporary database on the localhost

step 3:
run npm i on todoList folder
like : D:\Machine Test For Angular\todoList>npm i

step 4:
run ng serve --open on todoList folder
like : D:\Machine Test For Angular\todoList>ng serve --open

METHOD 2 : run through apache tomcat

i have shared a seprate folder with the build inside it
extract the folder and place it in tomcat->webapps
after that hit the url to access the build 
like : http://192.168.0.105:4561/todoList/
http://your ip address:apache tomcat port/todoList/

this method will also require the json-server to run for fetching the data from localhost data base
so perform step 1 and step 2

METHOD 3 : RUN WITH NODULE MODULE
step 1:
run json-server --watch db.json in workspace folder
like : D:\Machine Test For Angular>json-server --watch db.json

step 2:
run ng serve --open on todoList folder
like : D:\Machine Test For Angular\todoList>ng serve --open
